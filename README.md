changed bindings:
  1) alt + enter -> start git bash(needs to be edited to ur bash directory)
  2) alt + shift + s/d -> move window to prev/next workspace AND switch focus
  3) alt + z/x/c/v -> same as alt + h/j/k/l (siwtch focus)
  4) alt + shift + z/x/c/v -> same as alt + shift + h/j/k/l (move window)
  5) fixed gaps

NOTES:
  I was struggling alot with the fact that the first goes command and THEN the bind, like:
  - command
    bindings[]
